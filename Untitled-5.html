      <p><strong>Web 1.0 (1989-2003) – HTML on top of HTTP – consumed by humans, mostly readers and a few authors</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Web 2.0 (2004-2010) – Web 1.0 + AJAX, XML – consumed by humans and machines with many readers and authors</strong><img src="favicon.ico.ico" width="74" height="68" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Modern Web (2011-) – Web 2.0 + HTML5 – includes mobile, cloud computing, real-time</strong><strong></strong></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Future or the Modern Web has several characteristics</strong>:</p>
  <p><strong>Contextual – the web will be &ldquo;personalized for the individual user based on their needs, their taste, who they are, what they are doing, who their friends are&rdquo;, etc. Personalization is driven by</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>static attributes: business, geography, role, language, etc.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>dynamic session-centric attributes: device, browsers, bandwidth, etc.</strong></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Web sites have used context in the past, but its usage will increase adding information such as location, the network of friends and their preferences. There will be a context architecture attached to the entire web experience.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Mobile – there will be browser and native web applications running on all sorts of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. According to Phifer, a new mobile service and social era will start in 2012, and data revenue will exceed voice revenue. The number of website accesses done via mobile devices will exceed those done through PCs in 2014. To be successful, companies will either have to create websites tailored to mobile devices or create native applications for smartphones and tablets.</strong>  </p>
  <p><strong>HTML5 – a new era for highly interactive web applications. RIA applications, based on Flash and Silverlight, will see their share diminished without being completely wiped out.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>UXP (User eXperience Platform) – represented by a suite of features including content management, collaboration, social, analytics, search used together to create new user experiences.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Social – the web will be social, either public such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or private being used inside organizations between employees or collaborating with customers or business partners. Phifer recommends all companies implement a policy for employees interacting with public social media.</strong>  </p>
  <p><strong>Cloud – cloud computing usage will grow in the future due to its benefits: speed,flexibility,agility,financial,simplicity, and convenience.</strong><a href="Untitled-1.html">Back To First Page</a></p>
